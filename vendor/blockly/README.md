# Blockly Vendor Directory

This folder contains the official Blockly engine and media assets for the BF6Portal Tool web UI.

- Do **not** open or serve any test or standalone HTML files from this directory.
- The only supported entry point for the editor is `web_ui/index.html`.
- All menus, overlays, and UI features are implemented in `web_ui/`.
- This directory is for engine code only (blockly.min.js, media/).

If you see a white Blockly screen or "Blockly Standalone Test" in the title bar, you are running the wrong UI. Please use the main web UI.
