# Things. WE NEED

This file is used to track, add, remove, and resolve unmatched and missing items from imported block screenshots.

## How to Use
- Add new screenshots to the table below as they are imported.
- Mark each screenshot as matched (mapped to a block type), unmatched (not yet mapped), or missing (expected but not found).
- Use this as a working catalog to keep your screenshot and block mapping process organized.
