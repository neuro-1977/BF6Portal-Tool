This is a placeholder for the official Blockly media assets.

To fully enable Blockly, copy the following files from the official Blockly distribution (https://github.com/google/blockly/tree/master/media) into this directory:

- sprites.png
- handopen.cur
- handclosed.cur
- click.mp3
- click.ogg
- delete.mp3
- delete.ogg
- 1x1.gif
- and any other files present in the official media/ directory

If you see missing icons, cursors, or sounds in the editor, ensure all these files are present.
