# Action Log (2025-11-29)

A timestamped log of all significant actions, chats, file edits, and decisions for the BF6Portal Tool project. This log is used for both textual and future graphical (e.g., .svg, graphviz) knowledgebase representations.

- [2025-11-29T00:00Z] User requested persistent, timestamped tracking of all actions, chats, file edits, and knowledge for graphical/textual knowledgebase. Vision: .svg or other visualizations, not just plain text.
- [2025-11-29T00:01Z] Copilot created session_db with README, project-history, important-decisions, and action log. Will update all documentation and references with each new addition.
- [2025-11-29T00:02Z] Continuing with Blockly integration and documentation updates as per user workflow vision.
- [2025-11-29T00:10Z] Backed up web_ui and blockly folders before refactor.
- [2025-11-29T00:11Z] Moved blockly core to vendor/blockly. Updated index.html to reference new location. Ensured web_ui only contains custom UI.
- [2025-11-29T00:12Z] Next: Test web UI and blockly integration, verify all functionality remains intact.
- [2025-11-29T00:13Z] Updated main.js to check vendor/blockly/media for assets. All diagnostics and error messages now reference the new structure. Ready for integration testing.
