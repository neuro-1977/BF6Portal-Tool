# Screenshot Documentation Index

This folder will contain documentation and analysis for each screenshot in the project. Each screenshot will have a corresponding markdown file with:
- Filename and path
- Description of what is shown
- Any relevant UI/UX notes
- Block types, categories, or features visible
- Any missing info or requests for that screenshot

---

## How to Use
- Add a new markdown file for each screenshot you analyze (e.g. `Screenshot 2025-11-29 014521.md`).
- Fill in the details as you review each image.
- Link to this index from the main PROMPT.md and MISSING_INFO_REQUESTS.txt as needed.

---

## Screenshots to Document
- See `dev/assets/img/screenshots/` and `assets/img/screenshots/` for all available images.
- Move completed docs here as you finish them.
