feat: Implement UI polish (wires, icons), nudging/complex snapping tests, and BlockMover refactor (partial)

This commit further enhances the editor's visual feedback, expands test coverage, and begins a major refactoring effort.

- **Connection Polish (Visual Wires):**
  - Implemented drawing of visual "wires" connecting nested value blocks to their parent parameter slots for improved clarity.
- **UI Polish - Category Icons:**
  - Modified sidebar category buttons to display specific image icons for better visual identification, falling back to block shapes if icons are unavailable.
- **Expanded Test Coverage:**
  - Added new unit tests to verify the block nudging functionality.
  - Added a test for detaching value blocks from parent parameter slots.
- **Refactoring & Cleanup:**
  - Started refactoring `source/Block_Mover.py` to use a more modular, dictionary-based dispatch for connection point definitions (partial implementation).
