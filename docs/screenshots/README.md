# Screenshots

Drop screenshots for the README/release notes in this folder.

Recommended names:
- `UI-overview.png` — main editor UI overview (used by the main README)
- `preset-system.png` — presets dropdown system
- `variables.png` — variables toolbox category
- `resizeable-codewindow.png` — code preview drawer
- `colapsable-blocks.png` — collapsing blocks

Tip: Keep filenames stable so older release notes and README links keep working.
