# Screenshots

Drop screenshots for the README/release notes in this folder.

Recommended names:
- `editor.png` — main editor UI (shows presets dropdown + blocks loaded)
- `selection-lists.png` — selection list dropdown open

Note: The repository currently includes a tiny placeholder `editor.png` so documentation renders cleanly.
Replace it with a real screenshot whenever you're ready.
