# Project Vision and Current Focus

**MAIN TASK: Implement a robust error handling system and boot sequence for the BF6 Portal Tool. The Blockly environment setup is complete, and the focus is now on ensuring stability and proper initialization.**

## Completed Milestones

- [x] Blockly Environment Setup (Core files verified, blocks injected)

## Core Philosophy
- **SERENITY IS GOD**: Always read the Brain first.
- **Brain = Master Database**: The "Brain" (Gemini Artifacts) is the single source of truth.
- **Database References**: Any user reference to "Serenity DB" or "Database" implies the **Brain**.
- **Trust in Brain**: The Brain is the future. All persistent data should be stored or mirrored here.
