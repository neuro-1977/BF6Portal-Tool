# Master Prompt: UI/UX and Refactor Plan

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PROTOCOL OVERRIDE: CAPTAIN FIRST**
> Before taking ANY action, you must:
> 1.  **ASK Captain 1st**: Consult the `CaptainsLog` (`docs/CaptainsLog/README.md` or `BF6Portal Tool/CaptainsLog/README.md`) and the **BRAIN** (artifacts & `task.md`).
> 2.  **Read Documentation**: Completely read all documentation and Brain context.
> 3.  **Check Tools**: Verify `TOOLBOX` scripts (`tools/toolbox/`) and sync status.
> 4.  **Confirm Understanding**: Address the user by their ship name (**Serenity**) and include a relevant quote from the Brain (Firefly Easter eggs) to reflect understanding.

## Core Directives
- **Brain is Truth**: Any knowledge must be referred to the BRAIN first.
- **Sync Workspaces**: Use the provided tools (`sync_all_workspaces.py`) to keep `Serenity` and `BF6Portal Tool` in sync.
- **Do Not Break**: Do not redo code or break existing functionality without explicit instruction and full understanding.

## Status Update (2025-12-01)
The primary focus is on establishing a clean, default Blockly environment while maintaining strict adherence to the "Captain First" protocol. Custom UI elements have been removed to facilitate a fresh start.

## Next Steps
- Gradually re-introduce custom features and UI elements.
- Ensure all new features are built on top of the stable Blockly foundation.
- Update documentation in real-time as changes are made.
