# Master Prompt: UI/UX and Refactor Plan

**STATUS UPDATE (2025-11-30):**
The primary focus is now on establishing a clean, default Blockly environment. Custom UI elements have been removed to facilitate a fresh start. The next steps involve methodically re-implementing features on top of a stable Blockly foundation.

## Next Steps
- Gradually re-introduce custom features and UI elements.
- Ensure all new features are built on top of the stable Blockly foundation.
- Update documentation in real-time as changes are made.
