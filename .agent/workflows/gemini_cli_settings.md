# Gemini CLI Settings

- The user wants me to run long-running tasks, like a web server, in a separate terminal or in the background so that the main terminal is not blocked. For Windows, I should use 'Start-Process' in PowerShell.
- Before any refactoring, I must do an extensive analysis of all necessary documentation rewrites and update the documentation first.
- Whenever making changes, especially refactoring, I must never break Blockly. If a fix is found, I should ensure it's stable and verified before implementing. I should prioritize not breaking the existing functionality.
